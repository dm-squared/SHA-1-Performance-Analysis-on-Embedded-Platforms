# ECE 4300 Spring 2022 - SHA-1 Performance Analysis on Common Embedded Platforms

## By: Derek Mata, Christopher Yamada, and Elizabeth Hwang

---

### Abstract
In this project, we will test the performance of the SHA-1 algorithm on three different embedded platforms:

1. Raspberry Pi 3B+
2. Raspberry Pi 4B
3. Jetson Nano 4GB

We will create a python script that will measure the elapsed time, execution time, memory utilization, CPU utilization, peak power consumption, and average power consumption.  We will run the python script on the same interpretter, version, and using the `hashlib` python library on each device.

### Dependencies for Measurements
- `psutil`
- `platform`
- `datetime`
- `time`
- `resource`
- `sys`
